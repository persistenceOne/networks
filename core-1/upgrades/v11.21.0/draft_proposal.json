  "summary": "# Persistence Core-1 v11.21.0 Upgrade\n\nThis proposal is to do a software upgrade to the v11.21.0 software tag of the Persistence codebase at [22492000](https://www.mintscan.io/persistence/block/22492000) block height. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for precise time.\n\n## Scope of the upgrade\n\n The PSTAKE team proposes to securely improve the user experience for the deprecation of its Cosmos Liquid Staking solution on Persistence One.\n\nSince its move to the Bitcoin Ecosystem, PSTAKE is actively deprecating its stkAssets and allowing users to claim back their initial deposits. This includes a robust utility that burns stkAssets and sends the underlying assets back. Users need to go to the PSTAKE front-end and manually claim their underlying assets.\n\nIt is proposed to upgrade the core-1 chain with a custom logic that performs the sole function of burning users’ idle stkAssets and sending them the respective Assets back directly, without any user interaction.\n\nSo far, users have claimed back the following: 40.45% of stkATOM, 10.41% of stkSTARS, 8.12% of stkDYDX, 6.31% of stkOSMO, and 0.71% of stkHUAHUA.\n\nConsidering the above progress and PSTAKE’s hard deadline of 30 September 2025 to keep deprecation support active, the proposed solution would fast-track a secure deprecation and also enhance the user experience significantly by eliminating the need for users to manually claim their funds back. \n\n## Change log\n\n- Full changelog [here](https://github.com/persistenceOne/persistenceCore/compare/v11.17.0...v11.21.0).\n\n## How to upgrade\n\n[Upgrade using cosmovisor](https://docs.persistence.one/build/nodes-and-endpoints/node-operations/cosmovisor-upgrades)\n[Upgrade manually](https://docs.persistence.one/build/nodes-and-endpoints/node-operations/manual-upgrades)\n\n## Communications\n\nOperators are encouraged to join the `#validators-discussion` channel of the Persistence Community Discord. This channel is the primary communication tool for operators to ask questions, report upgrade status, report technical issues, and build social consensus should the need arise. If you don't have access, please contact someone from the Persistence team directly.\n"
