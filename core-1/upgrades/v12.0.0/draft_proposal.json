  "summary": "# Persistence Core-1 v12.0.0 Upgrade\n\nThis proposal is to do a software upgrade to the v12.0.0 software tag of the Persistence codebase at [22892000](https://www.mintscan.io/persistence/block/22892000) block height. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for precise time.\n\n## Scope of the upgrade\n\nThe PSTAKE team proposes to securely improve the user experience for the deprecation of its Cosmos Liquid Staking solution on Persistence One. \n\nThis proposal is a follow-up to Prop 137, where all idle stkAssets on the chain were burnt and all user funds were sent back to respective holders. \n\nIt is proposed to upgrade the core-1 chain to perform the following actions:\n\n1. Re-run the custom logic to burn users’ idle stkAssets and send them the respective Assets back directly, without any user interaction.\n\n2. Remove redundant modules like ibcfee, groups, interchainquery, liquistakeibc, ratesync, ibchook, skip builder pob, and oracle\n\n3. Fix a minor bug related to validator-bond in the LSM module\n\n4. Update all dependencies to match the cosmos v0.47.x latest version\n\nThe removal of unused modules will lead to better chain resilience as risk vectors are further minimized. While burning idle stkAssets will get PSTAKE’s Cosmos Liquid Staking deprecation one step closer to completion, safely and securely.  \n\nConsidering the progress so far and PSTAKE’s hard deadline of 30 September 2025 to keep deprecation support active, the proposed solution would fast-track a secure deprecation and also safeguard the Persistence core-1 chain.\n \n\n## Change log\n\n- Full changelog [here](https://github.com/persistenceOne/persistenceCore/compare/v11.21.0...v12.0.0).\n\n## How to upgrade\n\n[Upgrade using cosmovisor](https://docs.persistence.one/build/nodes-and-endpoints/node-operations/cosmovisor-upgrades)\n[Upgrade manually](https://docs.persistence.one/build/nodes-and-endpoints/node-operations/manual-upgrades)\n\n## Communications\n\nOperators are encouraged to join the `#validators-discussion` channel of the Persistence Community Discord. This channel is the primary communication tool for operators to ask questions, report upgrade status, report technical issues, and build social consensus should the need arise. If you don't have access, please contact someone from the Persistence team directly.\n"
